# **AQUA - Air Quality Analytics**

## **Pollution Reporting:**

This module allows the users to generate and array of statistics at different aggregation levels in the CSV datasets

## **Mobility Intelligence:**

This module measures the walkability of the map provided by isolating the different colour pixels and finding the different connected components.
In this module I have also included a function which outputs text files with the connected components listed, seperate ordered version of this file and the top 2 connected components in a jpg image.

## **Real-Time Monitoring:**

This module displays real time data from the London Air API [(https://www.londonair.org.uk/Londonair/API/)](https://www.londonair.org.uk/Londonair/API/). Using the matplotlib and requests library to display the data provided as different types of graphs.

## **User Interface:**

This module is a text-based interface through which the user interacts with the ACQUA system. 

## **Utilities:**

This module contains functions which aid with the operations of the rest of the modules.
